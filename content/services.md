## Design

The World of [E-Commerce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecommerce.asp) can be confusing.

Cryptic jargon and needless technical detail make it easy for the average reader to get disheartened, making the road to developing getting a website that <b>really drives value</b> for your business seem like a pipedream.

Instead of <i>reiterating documentation</i>, we will <b>walk you through</b> a selection of available solutions. We can even construct [quick prototypes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/agile-prototyping/) to help guide your choices. 

With a <i>seemingly endless</i> selection of Web Technologies now on the market for prospective business onwers, the World of Web Development has never been more accessible.

But with such a <b>plethora of options</b>, how do you choose? How can you evaluate whether one product will <i>allow you to scale</i> better than another? The answer may be closer than you think: 
> at Scott Dot Dev, we aim to <b>minimise development lead times</b> by matching you with a Software Product that meets as many of your requirements as possible, resulting in a robust final product ready to handle customers.

When developing with us, we champion clarity:
 - _clarity_ in understanding exactly what **you want** from your Web Service
- _clarity_ in ensuring that you **understand the steps** involved and what **each one involves** on a high level.

## Build

As we begin to write code, we ensure that you are in the loop.

You will be invited to join a [review](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-reviews) every fortnight where the most recent advancements on the project will be shared. This kind of meeting is part of the ['Scrum'](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) methodology of Software Development: a <i>proven</i> and <i>dependable</i> framework that champions <b>regular feedback</b> and <b>highly adaptable</b> development teams.

Should any critical issues arise, we will be online throughout business hours to help get things back on 
track.

Sit back, relax, and watch your site take shape.

## Deployment

The final hurdle in any development cycle is getting a site online.

Hosting providers can be hard to chose from, and will sometimes be constrained by the type of web technology that we have chosen to construct the site with.

If you are confident with your web hosting capabilities (or have an existing provider), you can choose to manage this phase yourself, or you can opt to allow Scott Dot Dev to integrate the hosting and deployment of your website into the development process, selecting from a list of pre-approved hosting providers.

If you choose to go it alone with your Web Hosting setup, there are a couple of topics that may require your attention:

- [domain registrations](https://www.siteground.co.uk/kb/domain_name_registration/) - To give your site a recognisable name
- [SSL certificates](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) - an essential part of handling user traffic securely
- [Web deployments](https://devjavu.space/post/a-beginners-guide-to-web-deployment/?isDark=true) - how you get your finished website on to the web securely
