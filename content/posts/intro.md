## 2024

2024 is a year of transition. After leaving my role as a Software Developer I have put my heart into finding a new outlet for skillsets in ways that I feel programming could not.

As such, I have developed a completely new portfolio site in order to demonstrate my skillset in some of the fields which I feel align better with me in terms of career, i.e: Marketing, Creative Writing, Website restyling for businesses

Chock full of fancy words and creative endeavours I hope you enjoy the eclectic nature of my portfolio! :D

This Portfolio site is built upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a golang based Static-Site builder, using the [Blowfish](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blowfish/) theme. With my profile card which you can see above I have attached a wide range of links to my profiles on various sites, such as:

 - **[medium](https://medium.com/)** - A .site for publishing guides, opinion pieces, some types of journalistic writing
 - **[github](https://github.com/scotta38)** - A site for displaying and collaborating on open-source code repositories.
 - **[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-anderson-09014173/)** - My career profile can be seen on here, including professional experience.
 - **[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8814328/scott-anderson)** - My profile on popular Q&A site 'stackoverflow'
