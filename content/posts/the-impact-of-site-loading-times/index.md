According to the [ITU](https://www.itu.int/itu-d/reports/statistics/2025/10/15/ff25-internet-use/), **over 6 billion people are active internet users in 2025** (an uptick of 200 million from 2024). :

First off, such a vast pool of users gives your brand the potential for unprecedented visibility towards your target audience. It provides you the opportunity to broadcast your unique message directly to the consumer, impacting the masses.

Conversely, such a titanic surge in online users also implies a horde of seriously fierce competition rallying against your every efforts to showcase your vision and offering - it can prevent you from getting a foothold within your niche. 

With both of these factors in mind, how can you ensure that your unique offering is given the best possible chance to flourish online? By taking care of basics, you can nourish your seedling of a website into a glorious, beautiful Sunflower of a platform.
