## A musical campervan

In early 2024, with 3 years of Software Engineering experience under my belt at some fantastic companies I left my job, my work and my home in a [1992 Talbot Express AutoQuest](https://classiccars.fandom.com/wiki/Talbot_Express) to pursue busking, nature and the open road. I had some good times, and some downright desperate times as busking became progressively more difficult, but ultimately I made some great memories, saw some fantastic places I never would have known about in the UK, and learnt a lot about how van life can be.

Some time away from work gave me some great insights, mainly I realised that I have many skills to be grateful for alongside Web Development, such as: [Art](https://www.behance.net/scottrobertanderson), [Music](https://soundcloud.com/jerryrigg), Photo Editing and Digital Marketing. So I set to work creating this website, to showcase the full arsenal of my skills and seek out unique opportunities that speak to me.

### Programmed to deliver

My interest in software development began with side-projects. I progressed through a fantastic course called [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) with a simple dream of developing an app for signing up to 5-a-side football games for my friends.

I never finished the app, but the passion that this course imbued in me for solving problems led me to go to University to study [Computing](https://www.uos.ac.uk/study/bsc-computing/) at the University of Suffolk. Witnessing the mind-bendingly intricate mechanisms of computers, a textured history of the internet and coursemates building game engines got me hooked on writing code.

Professionally, I made my humble beginnings in a Web Development agency called [Scandiweb](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://scandiweb.com/&ved=2ahUKEwiI4LOPkf-IAxVtTkEAHTWvCx4QFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YUytAt0QUX6YCLCa2F68w) (based in Riga, Latvia) where I cut my teeth in the [Magento](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html&ved=2ahUKEwjb-c2lkf-IAxWBVUEAHfRNE1UQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0miRCgzU3-zaieOkp_MXZh) ecosystem, and progressed up the ranks to prestigious clients.

When I came back to the UK I started working for [Shopware AG](https://www.shopware.com/en/), a German Software provider who supply ecommerce solutions as competitor to Adobe's Magento. With many team events and a much higher standard of coding, including [Automated Testing](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/automated-testing), [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) and [Static analysis checking](https://phpstan.org/) I felt like an man in the presence of giants, but I as I slowly got to grips with each part of the Shopware product I progressed to a confidence in the company, contributing to many of the [AI-Copilot](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/features/shopware-rise/ai-copilot) features now seen in the product today.
