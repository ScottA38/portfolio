This is a short story I am planning to write, and is unrelated to Web Development.

It features a character at a series of points in their life, which are seemingly unrelated. As the story progresses the character develops through these candid moments.

# Chapter One: A Solitary Beach

Miles sat motionless on a pebbled beach in the South of England, looking up. His chestnut-brown eyes, tarnished with a single grey freckle on his left iris, gaze longingly out into the distance. Dilated way beyond reason in dying light of the day, his retinas sought that which some might describe as a sign, or something to mark this moment as significant. Silently (and fruitlessly), he cast himself upon the eternal wisdom of the Astral Gods once again. Tonight, just like so many nights past during this torturous Summer, his pleas fell upon deaf ears. “Maybe their eternal wisdom is now silence” he muttered miserably. Regardless of how ephemeral, Miles knew that something nestled between the constellations had once touched him, and he recalled these moments with gladness as he continued to scan the blackness above.

Miles’ family, back on the other side of the country, didn’t believe in hocus-pocus. Each time his mind turned to the blurry faces of his Mother, Father or Brother, he felt anguish at the sombre responses that would mark the retelling of each experience during their intermittent exchanges. “That was silly, wasn’t it?”. “Oh that sounds a bit weird”. “How scary!”. The anguish that he felt being so misunderstood washed over him again, leaving a familiar residue of bitterness. If he ever returned to his family’s doorstep for good, dealing with these feelings again would be the hardest part.

Angered by his uneventful search of the skies, Miles slid a phone from of his pocket, the glowing display bearing “Saturday 17th August” deep into his pupils, and hit the lock button. Seeing the date illuminated before him, he thought back to the weekend before last weekend and the euphoria of his experience - he had felt on top of the World, but trying to remember such feelings of elation right now had seemingly been doomed to misery. Glancing briefly upon the empty horizon, he struck his thumb deftly downwards on the touch-screen display to reveal a buffet of bright notifications frantically vying for his attention. 

At the top sat another messages from Fleur, duly responding to his lonely cries for comfort. He cursed his yet unrelenting lack of restraint, wishing he could leave her pure spirit alone for good. She was unmistakably beautiful, but so far away she might as well be a dream, just like the spirits above. He tried to resist the image of her as he had so many times, but he knew he was once again inside the loop, and the loop only releases you when you are at rock bottom.

# Chapter Two: Work

On following Monday - just after sunrise - the roaring cacophony of a preschool playtime ejected Miles from his shallow slumber. For the **third** time this morning, if not much more violently and vigorously than the previous times. Sifting desperately through the murky depths of his mind he recounted that he first rose to the ear-splitting din of a Moped screaming past. Then a neighbour running out the door to work. This time it was children.

The truth is, Miles would have been angry about any kind of interruption to his slumber. He simply didn't want to wake up, or face the day ahead. 

Miles despised mornings. The clamouring, frenzied people each performing their own little manic ritual to show they are part of the whole: risking their front bumper to dive into their favourite chain Coffee shop, going for a run which they only gave themselves 20 minutes total to perform. Civilised chaos. As much as Miles dissented early risers, he cast a wry smile over the fact that the children below (who banged relentlessly on the lids of bins, darted about aimlessly and shouted incoherent nonsense), likely had some sort of notion that what they were doing, on a basic level made little to no sense. As Miles' mind slipped slowly back into the sea of sheets below, he could just about pick out that one particularly deranged child roaring as loud as he could like a dinosaur.

About half an hour later, Miles sat in his state-of-the-art kneeling chair and nursed a cup of Coffee. He had that familiar feeling of dread about his first morning meeting of the day. He was hungover from last night's joint, and was playing callously with the notion of calling in sick from work. He toyed with the clock on his dual monitor PC setup, hiding and revealing it via different desktop windows. 2 versions of his day flashed before his eyes:

1) He calls in sick from work. He goes back to bed for 3 hours, between further bouts of sleep he tries to unpick the mess he had made with his ex-girlfriend/friend/potential love interest the previous night, doesn't suceed, feels panicked about being off of work again, and spends the rest of the day worrying about what he is probably missing, and whether he will have the balls to go in again tommorow and lie about what he was ill with.

2) He attends the meeting, with eyes like saucers, and attempts to seem normal. Even if Miles does survive the meeting without a significant faux pas he knows that he will spend the next 2 hours down a random rabbit hole, and will have run through about 5mg of vape juice and 3 coffees to try and resurrect his functiional brain from the fog.

As usual, Miles chooses the second option, but plays with the clock hoping (as usual at this time of the morning) that divine intervention will help him circumnavigate this desperately anxious predicament.

# Chapter Three: The Band

Everything was ready for Miles to leave for band practise. "Everything, except my fucking wallet!" he fumed through gritted teeth, "Why can't something I want to do go right?". He knew the answer was his drug addiction, but, as usual he didn't want to confront this problem at that specific time. Spitballing ideas Miles knew that Tim might cover some of the costs of the room, and he had a tenner sitting on his nightstand. He grabbed his phone, and started a call to Ian.
