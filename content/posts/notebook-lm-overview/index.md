Whilst a wandering aimlessly through group chats on Whatsapp, I stumbled upon an quite unorthodox message from a [Western Buddhist](http://bodhgaya.fwbo.org/bfwbo.htm). Even by the esoteric standards to which a Western Buddhist might hold oneself, this message qualified as markedly strange.

'THIS IS AMAZING' he proclaimed. Gushing excitedly, he gave a breif overview about a new A.I development from Google for helping you to take notes. Prior to my arrival, the message adorned with a few cursory emotes from other members of his community, yet the message still appeared wildly out of place in this setting.

"Yeah, yeah, we've heard this all before!" my inner-sceptic lamented, and ordered me to scroll on. "Aren't even group chats safe from A.I topics now?" he added, triggering a brief inner convulsion of existential panic. 

This commentary wasn't entirely unexpected - in my efforts to market [scottwebdev.net](https://scottwebdev.net) recently, I have weathered endless swathes of furious pro or anti-A.I. rhetoric on my Linkedin Newsfeed. Yet as my thumb descended to swiftly to scroll on, there came a brief moment's hesitation.

I have a burgeoning passion for writing articles, and as such I have frequently found myself losing track of fascinating little excerpts and tidbits which carry the seedlings of inspiration for fully-formed pieces. "Could this be the tool I need to finally get my facts straight and write more effortlessly?" I mused. Subsequently, an episode of [The Informed Life](https://theinformed.life/) came to mind that I had listened to in the car some time before - with Maggie Appleton as the guest and [Digital Gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) as the topic.

### Digital Gardening

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.
_[nesslabs.com](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up)_

Digital Gardens are constantly in a state of flux - intentionally so. The 'gardening' analagy is intentionally crafted such that followers of your site (or [substack](https://substack.com/about), etc.) can witness the growth of your knowledge on a frame-by-frame basis. Unlike conventional blogs, wherein there lies a risk of over-working articles or posts, the principle of 'Digital Gardening' invites you to lay it bare for all to see, cracks and crevices to boot.  

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) is a modern-day champion of the principle of Digital Gardening, but as she writes in her own explanation of the concept, this principle didn't begin with her, she instead credits [Mark Bernstein](https://www.markbernstein.org/) as the progenitor of Online Horticulturalism, and his Hypertext-based essay - 'Hypertext Gardens: Delightful Vistas'.

#### Delightful Vistas

To the uneducated, ['Delightful Vistas'](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/) could serve more considered as much an artistic experiment
or online Art installation as a landmark for representing a new literary adaptation for the online World.

Mark spends a significant amount of time addressing the **notion of structure** within [Hypertext documents](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/websites-apps/what-is-hypertext/) ('websites'), and what constitutes a truly enagaging experience for people interacting with it. For each new section, there is a lovingly crafted, poetic analogy with the real World, and an environment that humans innately know. Mark diminishes the concept of hard-and-fast rules for structure, proferring that:

> Rigid hypertext is streetscape and corporate office: simple, orderly, unsurprising. We may find the scale impressive, we admire the richness of materials, but we soon tire of the repetitive view... 

Conversely, a unconforming arrangements of information represents a forbidden forest:

> Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes.

Gardens (or their more sizeable counterparts, parks), represent a joyous middle-ground between hard edges and 

> Gardens and parks lie between farmland and wilderness. The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity. The park is wilderness, tamed for our enjoyment...

### NotebookLM

In many respects, then, [Google's NotebookLM](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/notebooklm-app/) adds a 4th dimension to the idea of websites as 3D, navigable space. Now, instead of emerging from a website covered with scratches and bruises from untamed lexical thicket, you have a new, attractive alternative - your own, _personalised_ guided tour of **the digital landscape within which you have found yourself**.

What's more, by adding data sources and notes of your own to the mix (or indeed supporting your original findings with additional files or webpages) you exercise your ability to morph the fabric of this digital environment to your very will. Adding that hastily made voice note you recorded in the queue at McDonald's drive-thru is no longer deranged rambling - such disjointed excerpts of information can help direct your path around digital obstacles, giving your 'virutal guide' clues about where you want to go and what you want to see.

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) accepts a varied range of input data, disseminating information from simple sources like raw PDFs and web pages, all the way down to self-transcribing that hastily-recorded voice note you made in a moment of inspiration at your local Tesco Express. In opposition to the 'Digital Gardening' analogy, NotebookLM is strictly a _pesonal_ research tool (lauded as 'your research and thinking partner' by it's publishers); whilst the powers-that-be at Alphabet Inc. grant you the privilege of sharing around the repositories of knowledge you've so lovingly crafted, NotebookLM's interface is strictly limited in style by corporate grey, and
