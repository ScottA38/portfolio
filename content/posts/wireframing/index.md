title: UX Wireframing
---

[Wireframing](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-wireframing/) is the process of designing the user flow of your site. This stage allows [stakeholders](https://agilemodeling.com/essays/stakeholders.htm) (i.e: you, senior management) to 'step-into' the customers' shoes and ideate about the flow of the website you are creating, i.e:

- Where page elements (pictures, text or logos) are positioned on the page
- Which areas of the page are interactive (can be clicked, hovered etc.). Is it clear that they require interaction?
- How the user will navigate through the site

Whilst we cannot provide a comprehensive UI/UX service here are Scott Dot Dev, through clear communication and discussion with our in-house developers, we can pinpoint down exactly what style makes your business tick, and hone in on that aesthetic later.

<i>Remember</i>, due to the iterative development patterns we utilise, if something arises in the development flow which doesn't quite float your boat, we will be on hand to listen to you feedback and right the ship!
