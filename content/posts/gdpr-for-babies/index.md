For those of you unaware of _just how much_ sensitive data is **transmitted over the World Wide Web** on a daily basis, it is high time you read up about what the [**GDPR**](https://gdprinfo.eu/) actually consists of _(instead of just spamming the 'Accept All' button each time you enter a website).

> '*Yeah, but it's so dry and boring*'. 

**Trust me, I know**. In fact, it is _especially menial_ for small businesses owners with **meagre budgets** and **virtually no resources**. The other possibility, however, is potential exposure to [eye-watering fines](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6763eb1fe6ff7c8a1fde9ba4/information_commissioner_data_protection_fining_guidance.pdf) (ca. 4% of your annual turnover), which makes doing your homework just that bit more attractive.

#### Disclaimer - I am not an expert

As you may have noticed already, this article seeks to entertain as much as it does to inform. If you want **the hard facts** about GDPR (I highly recommend this!), then please refer to this quick and painless video:

### A GDPR timeline for simpletons (like me)

An extremely reductive timeline of the events leading to the GDPR proceeds as follows: 

- **1994**: The World Wide Web was invented by [Tim Berners Lee](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/berners_lee_tim.shtml)
![Man gesturing that his head is exploding with stars around him](internet_wow.gif "A man gesturing that his head exploding")
- **1995**: The European Commission thinks 'Oh God this _World-Wide-Web_ thingy is a massive personal security risk' and implements the [European Data Protection Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1995/46/oj/eng)
- **Mid 2000s**: People are using Facebook to tell the World that they are 'hungover AF' and to send money to 'exiled African princes' via [Online Banking portals](https://financeonpoint.com/history-of-online-banking/)
![Facebook open on an early 'tens MacBook Pro](macbook_facebook.jpg "An early-generation Macbook showing the Facebook login screen")
- **2011**: The EU realises that people are now sending **_everything_** about their life over the internet'. They begin work on a new set of governing regulations for digital data collection.
- **2016**: The [**GDPR**](https://gdprinfo.eu/) as we know it today, came into effect. Except that it didn't (for the U.K at least), because of the British Prime Minister saying [this in 2014](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30250299)

> On the EU, most British people don't want a false choice between the status quo or leaving. They want reform and a referendum.

- **2018**: The political dumpster-fire and all-round circus act that was the Brexit negotiations led to the U.K needing to expunge any parts of the GDPR agreement which implied EU membership.
As a result, the British Government dropped their red-hot new ~~mixtape~~ legislation in the summer of '18, catchily named the 'UK GDPR'.

**Fast-forward to the present day**, where you **collect data from people via your website** in the _vain hopes_ of _maybe_ selling them something in the near future. 'Finally, a subscriber!' you cry as someone presses submit on your mailing list form. 

Before you go using your subscribers' email addresses for free spins at [galabingo.com](https://www.galabingo.com/), however, let's review what these policies really mean. Signing your client up to Gala Bingo (not affiliated) **_might just_** violate legitimate purpose.

### The 7 Principles of the UK GDPR

## 1. "Lawfulness, fairness & transparency"

![Harry Potter standing with head exposed from invisibility cloak](im-invisible-invisible.gif "Harry Potter wearing an invisibility cloak")

**Lawfulness of processing** is primarily concerned with having a [legal basis](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/), of which there are **6 fundamental types**. Identifying your legal basis can be tricky, so go steady with this. [Legal Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxgOJ6DHHM) comes to the rescue here once again with some simple guidance.

**Fairness** means that data shouldn't be processed in a way that is unexpected based on the stated purposes. Imagine your mate asking to look at your Pokemon cards and then handing them off to a stranger - so out of order! For example, if you were to submit your email address to the local baton-twirling society, and the next day your email inbox was flooded with emails from yo-yo enthusiasts, then you know that the baton-twirlers are not handling your data fairly!

**Transparency** stipulates that you should be clear about **what data you need**, and **how it will be stored** (i.e: in a [computer database](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zsfky4j/revision/1)), such that a consumer can understand the **complete timeline** of _what will happen to their personal information_. 

We are talking about **transparency**, not **invisibility** here - Harry's [Cloak of Invisibility](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility) won't help us comply with GDPR (but would still be super fun).

### 2. "Specified, explicit and legitimate purposes"

**Legitimate purpose** is pretty straighforward - tell the [data subjects](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-sharing/data-sharing-a-code-of-practice/glossary/) _exactly_ what you are going to do with their data, and **only do the stated thing**. If you were going to use their name and email address to sign up for newsletter don't register them for a hamster racing derby instead.

getting **consent** to data processing from your customers (a.k.a: [data subjects](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-sharing/data-sharing-a-code-of-practice/glossary/)). Make sure that you get an **explicit confirmation** from the customer that they accept your terms. Do you remember the ['Tea and Consent'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-34656527) video from back in 2015? Oh, hum, complicated example...

If you collect data from people you need to prove that you **need the data for specific purposes** (which you are able to spell out to them). Explicitly stating **the reason why you are collecting the data from them** should typically cover most of the rationale.

### 3. "Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary"

The **adequacy** of data refers to data being 


### Crafting your Privacy notice

Even if you are doing the right thing with your data-handling practises, it is essential that you publish a formal document to the public outlining any policies and practises you have in handling PII (Personally Identifiable Information), such that when external person/s interact with your business, you have verifiable means of consent with regard to your relationship to their personal data.

Here, once again, the ICO's office comes to the rescue with concrete guidance about [how to write a privacy notice](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/advice-for-small-organisations/privacy-notices-and-cookies/how-to-write-a-privacy-notice-and-what-goes-in-it/) and what areas it should include.

### Knowing how to tackle the GDPR

It's natural to feel nervous about GDPR compliance - it's a complicated landscape of legislation spanning a wide array of areas within business operations and requires detailed attention to understand.

When learning about topics within the GDPR It's good to set aside dedicated study time solely for the purpose of learning about and understanding the fundamental principles of the regulations.

To this end, the ICO provides a [whole host of resoures](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/i-m-worried-about-how-an-organisation-has-handled-my-information/) for organisations, which proceed through each aspect of the regulations in turn.
