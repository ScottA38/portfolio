### A shifting Landscape

In 2024, with multiple years of commercial Software Engineering experience under my belt, I came to a **realisation**: creating a **compelling presence online** requires _so much more_ than **just a good website**.

The landscape of online branding began to shift dramatically, almost as if sand under the feet, and **crafting a compelling identity** would now takes a lot more than just **knowing how to code**.

Enter **groundbreaking new concepts** like [Generative A.I](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai), [Website Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) and [Social Media marketing](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/how-to-get-started-with-social-media-marketing). These tools quickly **rendered themselves indispensable** in an already _dizzying array_ of available solutions for getting noticed online - potent forces in _reshaping your consumers' sensibilities_ about **where to look** and **how to spend their money**. 

Casting off as a freelancer, I set about immersing myself in learnings about Digital Branding for SME businesses and establishing myself as an **affordable**, **trustworthy** website designer/developer. My mission is simple:

> I want to tell _your_ brand story, a raw and unflitered statement of your business and the values it stands for.

My interest in software development began with side-projects. 

I remember flying through a fantastic course called [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) with a simple dream of developing an app for signing up to 5-a-side football games for my friends.

The passion that this dream imbued in me for solving problems led onwards to the University of Suffolk to study [Mobile and Web Engineering](https://www.uos.ac.uk/study/bsc-computing/) at the University of Suffolk.  I didn't finish the course, but witnessing the mind-bendingly intricate mechanisms of computers, a textured history of the internet and coursemates building game engines got me hooked on writing code.

Professionally, I made my humble beginnings in a Web Development agency called [Scandiweb](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://scandiweb.com/&ved=2ahUKEwiI4LOPkf-IAxVtTkEAHTWvCx4QFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YUytAt0QUX6YCLCa2F68w) (based in Riga, Latvia) where I cut my teeth in the [Magento](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html&ved=2ahUKEwjb-c2lkf-IAxWBVUEAHfRNE1UQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0miRCgzU3-zaieOkp_MXZh) ecosystem, and progressed up the ranks to prestigious clients.

When I came back to the UK I started working for [Shopware AG](https://www.shopware.com/en/), a German Software provider who supply ecommerce solutions as competitor to Adobe's Magento. With many team events and a much higher standard of coding, including [Automated Testing](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/automated-testing), [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) and [Static analysis checking](https://phpstan.org/) I felt like an man in the presence of giants, but I as I slowly got to grips with each part of the Shopware product I progressed to a confidence in the company, contributing to many of the [AI-Copilot](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/features/shopware-rise/ai-copilot) features now seen in the product today.
