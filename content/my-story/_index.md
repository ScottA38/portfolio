### A shifting Landscape

In 2024, with multiple years of commercial Software Engineering experience under my belt, I came to a **realisation**: creating a **compelling presence online** requires _so much more_ than **just a good website**.

The landscape of online branding began to shift dramatically, almost as if sand under the feet, and **crafting a compelling identity** would now takes a lot more than just **knowing how to code**.

Enter **groundbreaking new concepts** like [Generative A.I](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai), [Website Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) and [Social Media marketing](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/how-to-get-started-with-social-media-marketing). These tools quickly **rendered themselves indispensable** in an already _dizzying array_ of available solutions for getting noticed online - potent forces in _reshaping your consumers' sensibilities_ about **where to look** and **how to spend their money**. 

In early 2025, I set about immersing myself in learnings about Digital Branding for SME businesses and establishing myself as an **affordable**, **trustworthy** website designer/developer. My mission is simple:

> I want to tell _your_ brand story, a raw and unflitered statement of your business and the values it stands for.

**My career** in Software Development _began_ with side-projects. 

I can vividly recall _flying_ through a online tutorials and a course called ['Learn Python the Hard Way'](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) by the fantastic [Zed Shaw](https://zedshaw.com/). My motivation was  **simple dream** of **developing a mobile app** for my local 5-a-side football team (a real-time live sign-up sheet monitor attendance thresholds). 

The **passion that this idea imbued** for **solving problems** spurred me onwards to the **University of Suffolk** to study **[Mobile and Web Engineering](https://www.uos.ac.uk/study/bsc-computing/)**. Witnessing the **mind-bendingly intricate mechanisms** of Computers, absorbing the **textured history of the Internet** and seeing coursemates heads-down **building game engines** got me _hooked_ on writing code.

I made my **humble beginnings** as a **professional Web Developer** through working for a brilliant agency called [Scandiweb](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://scandiweb.com/&ved=2ahUKEwiI4LOPkf-IAxVtTkEAHTWvCx4QFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2YUytAt0QUX6YCLCa2F68w) whilst living in Riga, Latvia. This role allowed me to rapdily cut my teeth on the then-influentual [Magento 2 Ecosystem](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html), progressing into **more and more responsibility in client-facing roles** with some prestigious names.

After **returning back to the UK**, I switched gears into Enterprise Programming, joining **German E-Commerce giant [Shopware AG](https://www.shopware.com/en/)** the likes of whom supply a range of advanced E-commerce products, fiercely rivalling industry giants such as **[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/uk)** and **[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.co.uk/)**. By this point in time, Shopware had already superseded the now dwindling Magento I had been accustomed to. To accept this role was a **big step up in my programming career** and demanded a **far superior standard of coding**, regular **team training** events and myriad opportunities to visit **prestigious events** like [PHP UK](https://www.phpconference.co.uk/).

Through this role, my eyes were opened to the importance of [Automated Testing](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/automated-testing), [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) and [Code Static Analysis](https://phpstan.org/). Some of my colleagues possessed formidable skill in coding, and I often felt like I was walking in the presence of giants, but I as I slowly got to grips with each new concept I progressed slowly to aptitude within the company, contributing to many of the [AI-Copilot](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/features/shopware-rise/ai-copilot) features now seen in the product today, such as the ['Review Translator'](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/features/shopware-rise/shopware-ai#ai-based-translation-for-reviews) feature.
