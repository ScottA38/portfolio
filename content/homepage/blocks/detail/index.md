### Why Scott Web Dev?

_After years_ working with **high-level Software Development** clients, I _saw a pattern_.

Small businesses and indepedent companies with lovingly-crafted websites losing business over trivial issues, like: 

- [Unoptimised images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/performance/insights/image-delivery?hl=en) **decreasing responsiveness** and **affecting site search** ranking.
- The introduction of [redundant web code](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr) that **decrease performance** and even **introduce security vulnerabilities**. 
- A lack of awareness for Web Page structuring [semantic tagging](https://developers.google.com/style/semantic-tagging) leading to a **poor user experience for disabled users**.

Down-to-Earth, empathic guidance on topics like **Site Performance**, **Web Accessibility** or **Asset Optimisation** can be the difference between a compelling user experience and a disorienting one.

At **Scott Web Dev**, we help you to tackle issues **big or small** which are preventing your **site from ranking**, your **pages from performing** and your **brand from shining** ✨.
