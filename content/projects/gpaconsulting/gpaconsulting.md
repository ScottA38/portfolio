# Website commission: GPA Consulting

GPA Consulting is a local insurance consulting firm based in Rayleigh, Essex. They approached me with a simple brief - design a **simple static website** which contains essential company information and contact details.

In order to provide a performant solution, I opted for [hugo](https://gohugo.io), a modern [Static Site Builder](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) with plenty of customisation options.

### Theming the site

In terms of theming on Hugo, I selected the [Hugo Scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-scroll/) theme, a visually effective coninuous-scroll design.

## Showcase

The team at GPAConsulting is a tightly-knit group of specialists. In order to convey their strong sense of community spirit the hero image for the site is conveys a silhouette of a team.

### Collapsible Services section

Some visual flair was added in the 'Services' section, where clicking the heading for a specific section will allow a full description to 'fly out'
