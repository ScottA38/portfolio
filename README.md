# Scott Dot Dev's Web Development Portfolio site

Welcome to my portfolio site, built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site builder

I decided to update my portfolio in 2024, whilst looking for work, as I discovered that my skills and interests extend far further than just Web Development. All in all I have skills in:

- Programming - PHP, JavaScript - Web Development
- Digital Marketing - Copywriting, Social Media Content Production
- Design - Adobe Illustrator, Video Editing

## Portfolio Content

This portfolio will not have any demo material of sites I have created, however there will be:

- Blog Articles on topics relevant to Digital Marketing, Web Development and/or Design
- Static showcases of Websites I have produced for clients
- Information about me and how I can be contacted for Web Development/Digital Marketing/Design work
